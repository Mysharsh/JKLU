# SILENTVERSE


1. Many people were unable to ----
Explore, Enjoy, and Interact with strangers - in different cities, monuments, Events,
parties, concerts etc.

2. There is a lack of opportunity to explore the campus before admission, due to distance
may result in a sense of uncertainty or discomfort among students. It can also lead to
potential mismatches between students' expectations and the actual campus environment.

3. Metaverse provides us, with convenient training for hostages and helps them to off the Real World 
problem with the Virtual World.

## Features
- Teaching aids
- virtual reality in elementary and primary schools.
- virtual reality platform for TOURISM.

### We are creating a Virtual Environment which is the exact replica of the real world.


- The Virtual Environment where users can meet, socialize and celebrate time together,
even if they can't afford or wish to leave their homes.

- And users also enjoy and interact with their friends and strangers by playing different
activities.


## SOLUTION

we are creating a Metaverse-like AR 3D version of
cities and locations like-- Red Fort, India Gate and
other places like college visits and cities.

**Silentverse** is a virtual environment that is highly
inter-operable,
This means the user will able to move freely across
the places and explore them from their homes.

With this, You're able to Socialize with Friends, attend
concerts, events, or explore the rich culture
heritage and localization of India.
